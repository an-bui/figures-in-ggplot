# Figures in `ggplot`

These materials were written for [UCSB EEMB R Seminar](https://github.com/UCSB-RSeminar), Winter 2023.

## Slides

The slides use visualizations from the `palmerpenguins` [package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) as a base to discuss basic data visualization. The last slide is a [compiled list of resources](https://an-bui.github.io/figures-in-ggplot/slides/seminar-slides#/resources) for casual perusing.
